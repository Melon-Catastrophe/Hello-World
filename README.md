# Overview

This is a simple program to help me learn how to use Git with VSCodium and to better learn how GitHub works. The program simply prints "Hello World" to the terminal.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

The IDE that I used was VSCodium with a built in git extension to help me publish to GitHub. 

I used Python 3.9.0 to make this program.
